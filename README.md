## 1. Project Description

The scope of this project was to understand the causes of employee turnover in a big company and predict which employees are most likely to leave.

The project was divided into 3 stages:
- profile the employees who left the company,
- understand the reasons that led them to leave the company,
- predict which employees are most likely to leave.

For the first and second stages, I used python both to analyze (Pandas, Numpy and Statsmodels libraries) and visualize the data (Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries). For data viz and dashboards, I also used Tableau.

For the third stage, I used python's Scikit-Learn library to create the supervised machine learning prediction model.

This was my final project as an Ironhack's data analytics bootcamp student. The aim of the project was to choose a topic and perform an end-to-end analysis using what we've learned throughout the course. For more details about the context and/or the requirements to meet, please check folder [0_Context](https://github.com/Ana-Andre/Predictive-Emplyee-Turnover/tree/master/0_Context).

I used Trello as a project management tool with Kanban methodologies.

## 2. Motivation

A company's success is also built on the people who work there.

Employees turnover has a dramatic impact in business mainly because:
- it's very costly to replace an employee (the separation, the recruitment, the replacement, the training)
- it affects produtivity: voids in the workforce mean overwork and stress for the ones staying and also because it destabilizes the team and the mood
- it affects business as it can deteriorate client's satisfaction due to regular changes in consultants and that can lead to loss of business with clients.

Employees engagement is more and more a concern for organizations and human resources analystics holds enormous value for them as it is a way to measure the business impact of people policies.

## 3. Dataset
* Where did you get your data? If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.
* Did you build your own datset? If so, did you use an API or a web scraper? PRovide the relevant scripts in your repo.
* For all types of datasets, provide a description of the size, complexity, and data types included in your dataset, as well as a schema of the tables if necessary.
* If the question cannot be answered with the available data, why not? What data would you need to answer it better?


<a name="workflow"></a>
## 4. Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?


<a name="questions"></a>
## 5. Questions
* What data/business/research/personal question you would like to answer?
* What is the context for the question and the possible scientific or business application?
* What are the hypotheses you would like to test in order to answer your question?  
Frame your hypothesis with statistical/data languages (i.e. define Null and Alternative Hypothesis). You can use formulas if you want but that is not required.


<a name="cleaning"></a>
## 6. Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did as well as your reasoning behind the process.


<a name="analysis"></a>
## 7. Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.


<a name="model-training-and-evaluation"></a>
## 8. Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.


<a name="conclusion"></a>
## 9. Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.


<a name="future-work"></a>
## 10. Future Work (ongoing..)
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.
