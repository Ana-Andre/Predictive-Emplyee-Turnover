## Project Description

The scope of this project was to predict whether a room in an office building is occupied or not, using sensor records for temperature, humidity, light, and carbon dioxide levels inside the room. This information can then be integrated in the HVAC control systems and used to improve their algorithm and performance, promoting the building's energy efficiency and sustainability.

I developed this project as an Ironhack's data analytics bootcamp student. The aim of the project was to choose a topic and implement a solution using a supervised machine learning algorithm. For more details about the context and/or the requirements to meet, please check folder [0_Context](https://github.com/Ana-Andre/Room_Occupancy_Detection/tree/master/0_Context).

To analyze the data, I used Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. For the prediction, I built a classifier with Scikit-Learn library.


<a name="hypotheses-questions"></a>
## Hypotheses / Questions
* What data/business/research/personal question you would like to answer?
* What is the context for the question and the possible scientific or business application?
* What are the hypotheses you would like to test in order to answer your question?  
Frame your hypothesis with statistical/data languages (i.e. define Null and Alternative Hypothesis). You can use formulas if you want but that is not required.


<a name="dataset"></a>
## Dataset
* Where did you get your data? If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.
* Did you build your own datset? If so, did you use an API or a web scraper? PRovide the relevant scripts in your repo.
* For all types of datasets, provide a description of the size, complexity, and data types included in your dataset, as well as a schema of the tables if necessary.
* If the question cannot be answered with the available data, why not? What data would you need to answer it better?


<a name="cleaning"></a>
## Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did as well as your reasoning behind the process.


<a name="analysis"></a>
## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.


<a name="model-training-and-evaluation"></a>
## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.


<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.


<a name="future-work"></a>
## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.


<a name="workflow"></a>
## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?


<a name="organization"></a>
## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.


<a name="links"></a>
## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and trello/kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
